    "**Abstract**\n\n",
    "Machine learning models are often used to automate loan approval decisions. Usually, these models give a prediction for every loan application, even when they are not very sure about the decision. In financial systems, such overconfident but incorrect predictions can be risky.\n",
    "In this project, I built a confidence-aware loan approval system where the model is allowed to say “I don’t know” when it is unsure. Instead of forcing a decision on every case, the system rejects low-confidence predictions. Experiments show that by doing this, the accuracy of accepted predictions improves to 93%, while the model makes decisions on 58% of the cases. This shows how rejecting uncertain predictions can make AI systems safer for real-world financial use.\n",

    "**1. Introduction**\n\n",
    "Loan approval is an important decision-making process in banks and financial institutions. A wrong decision can cause financial loss or risk. Machine learning models are commonly used to automate this process, but most models focus only on improving accuracy.\n",
    "However, higher accuracy does not always mean safer decisions. Models can sometimes be very confident even when they are wrong. This is especially dangerous in finance.\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a system that not only predicts loan approval but also understands when it is unsure and avoids making risky decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Dataset**\n\n",
    "The dataset used in this project contains information about loan applicants, such as:\n",
    "•\tIncome and asset values\n",
    "•\tCredit score (CIBIL)\n",
    "•\tLoan amount and loan term\n",
    "•\tEducation and employment status\n",
    "The target column, Loan_Status, indicates whether a loan was Approved (1) or Rejected (0).\n",
    "Before training the model, the data was cleaned, categorical values were encoded, and the dataset was split into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Methodology**\n\n",
    "3.1 Baseline Model\n\n",
    "A logistic regression model was used as the baseline classifier. This model was chosen because it is simple, interpretable, and provides probability values for predictions.\n\n",
    "3.2 Model Confidence\n\n",
    "Instead of using only the final prediction, the probability output of the model was used as a measure of confidence. Higher probability means the model is more confident in its decision.\n\n",
    "3.3 Selective Prediction\n\n",
    "A confidence threshold was introduced:\n",
    "•\tIf the model’s confidence is above the threshold, the prediction is accepted.\n",
    "•\tIf the confidence is below the threshold, the model rejects the prediction.\n",
    "Rejected cases are assumed to be sent for manual review by a human.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Results**\n\n",
    "When a confidence threshold of 0.8 was used:\n",
    "•\tThe model made predictions on 58% of the cases (coverage).\n",
    "•\tThe accuracy on these accepted predictions increased to 93%.\n",
    "This shows that rejecting uncertain predictions improves the reliability of decisions, even though fewer predictions are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Business Logic**\n\n",
    "In real-world deployment, rejected loan applications are not ignored. Instead, they are forwarded to loan officers for manual evaluation. This creates a human and AI collaboration, where the model handles confident cases and humans handle uncertain ones.\n",
    "Such a system reduces risk while still improving efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Conclusion**\n\n",
    "This project shows that machine learning models should not always be forced to make decisions. Allowing a model to reject low-confidence predictions leads to safer and more reliable outcomes, especially in financial applications. Confidence-aware systems can help bridge the gap between automation and responsible decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Future Work**\n\n",
    "This project can be extended by:\n",
    "•\tUsing advanced uncertainty estimation methods\n",
    "•\tTesting the approach with larger datasets\n",
    "•\tStudying fairness and bias in rejected cases\n"
