# Self-Aware Loan Approval System

This project implements a confidence-aware loan approval system that allows a machine learning model to abstain from low-confidence predictions.

## Key Features
- Logistic Regression baseline model
- Confidence vs correctness analysis
- Selective prediction using confidence thresholds
- Accuracy–coverage trade-off evaluation
- Human-in-the-loop decision logic

## Results
- Accuracy on accepted predictions: ~93%
- Coverage at threshold 0.8: ~58%

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
Loan approval dataset sourced from Kaggle.
